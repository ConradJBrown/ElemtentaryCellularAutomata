# ElemtentaryCellularAutomata
	This is a demonstration of Elementary Cellular Automata using a simple showing of the rules
	This program is for simulating the Elementary Cellular Automata in your Terminal
	The code will take in the values given in the terminal
	first the size you want each cell to be
	second the rule you want to implement to design it
	for example:
	java CA 20 90
	will output:
